Regular Expressions allow strings to be examined in several ways, finding matching patterns.

"I am a full-stack developer" can sometimes be written as "I am a full stack developer"

full.stack -> the . is like a wild card.  Any character will match
full.*stack -> The wild card can apply over any number of characters between full and stack.  For example, 'full and I like to eat pizza by the stack' will be a match
full[ -]*stack -> This will match any length of characters that consist of the characters in the brackets.  So in this case, 'full - stack' will be a match
[a-z] -> This is a range, and will find all letters between a and z, but is case sensitive
[A-Za-z] -> This will find all letters in both cases
[A-Za-z]* -> The * means 'zero or more', so it will match entire chunks that match, rather than each letter.  Essentially, matches words
\w* -> Shorthand for the above, finding entire words
[^\w]* -> Find everything that ISN'T a word.  ^ means 'not'
\W -> Shorthand for non-words

Let's match a five-digit zip code (55414)

[0-9]* -> Will match, as it finds all numerical characters of any length
\d -> Shorthand for digits
-These will not work, as shorter or longer strings will match
\d{5} -> This specifies that the length must be five digits

HOWEVER, 'I live in 55414, near the university' will be a match, despite the rest of the string being invalid
Use boundaries to specify the beginning and end
^ -> Start of line
$ -> End of line
^\d{5}$ -> This will accept ONLY a 5-character numerical string, nothing before or after

US zip code system accepts an additional 4 digits after a hyphen, which is optional, for example: 55414-1234
^\d{5}-\d{4}$ -> This pattern will accept this form of zip code.  However, the original five-length zip code will no longer match
Wrapping it in ()? will indicate it is optional
^\d{5}(-\d{4})?$

Let's split a string by the non-word elements: 'JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Java'
\W+ -> Selects one or more (+) non-word characters

What if it was listed as 'JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Java'
\W+(and\W+)?




Take this sentence: 'Procrastination is surely not the destination.  Should we talk about shiny things?'
Find the 'sh' sounds
sh|ti|su -> The pipe is an 'or' selector.  Let's select the entire word!
(\w*(sh|ti|su)\w*)

'Surely capturing shushes shall show how beneficial Regular Expressions actually are'

Let's ignore the case, as in 'Surely'
(?i) -> Ignore case, but has an alternative in Java Pattern, Pattern.CASE_INSENSITIVE
